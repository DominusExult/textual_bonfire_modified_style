# Bonfire

Bonfire is a nice and light theme for Textual based around the same asthetics as
37signals' popular [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com) chat web service.  Dark sides
can be turned on and off with `Darken main window colors` check box in preferences.
I just happen to like them dark, so that's what I used for the sample snap.
