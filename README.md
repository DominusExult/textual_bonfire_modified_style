# Bonfire Modified DARK

Bonfire Modified DARK is a heavy modification of Josh Goebel's [Bonfire theme](https://github.com/yyyc514/textual_bonfire_style) for Textual 
(in turn based around the same asthetics as 37signals' popular [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com) 
chat web service).

It also borrows the emoji/emoticon support and collapsing topics (hover over tosee full topic) of [Simplified Light Modifications](https://github.com/hbang/Simplified-Light-Modifications).
The emoticons *only* show with new messages, old messages are not parsed for this.

Also, please excuse obvious plunders. I have no real idea about java script 
![What it looks like](https://raw.github.com/DominusExult/textual_bonfire_modified_style/master/bonfire_mod_snap.png)

## Textual 2.1.1

This only supports Textual 2.1.1 and newer because of the recent [theme engine
changes][theme_engine]. 
### Installation

    cd ~/Library/Containers/com.codeux.textual/Data/Library/
    cd Application\ Support/Textual\ IRC/Styles/
    git clone git://github.com/DominusExult/textual_bonfire_modified_style.git
