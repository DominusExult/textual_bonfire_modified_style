# Bonfire Modified DARK

Bonfire is a nice and light theme for Textual based around the same asthetics as
37signals' popular [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com) chat web service.  Dark sides
can be turned on and off with `Darken main window colors` check box in preferences.
I just happen to like them dark, so that's what I used for the sample snap.

## Textual 2.1.1

This only supports Textual 2.1.1 and newer because of the recent [theme engine
changes][theme_engine].

    cd Application\ Support/Textual\ IRC/Styles/
